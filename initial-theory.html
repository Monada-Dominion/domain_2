        <h2>2.1.1: Multidimensional meditation - theory. Dot & void</h2>

        <p>
            Welcome to the second domain of Monada Dominion: Multidimensional Meditation.
        </p>
        <p>
            By now you could have already completed the first section - Mindfulness & Mindfitness. And might have done various exercises and practices with attention, goal setting and concentration. This will be helpful for you on this journey. More you gained from the first section - the more you will understand in the second.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, the first section is not obligatory or necessary to do this meditation. Moreover, it is not even necessary to follow the default order - you are free to pick up any card with any step of meditation.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was designed to provide immediate access to particular states arranged or tied to the order of the universal matrix. Yet, it seems logical and correct to go step by step and gradually explore states.
        </p>

        <h3>Why do this meditation?</h3>
        <p>
            If you don't know what meditation is, this is the right place to find out. If you know or already have experience, then you might enrich it with this original practice.
        </p>
        <p>
            The reason to do it and most importantly to complete all steps is an elegant and intuitive system of navigation in the space of different states of consciousness. Practically, each step is tied to a different state of consciousness and meditation teaches to identify them and differentiate.
        </p>
        <p>
            While visual heuristic of the universal matrix serves as a system of portals or keys that allow quick and targeted state access. In two words, you remember symbols and enter specific states.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, this is highly dependent on your skill. And for some people it might be slower, more difficult or don't work at all. Yet, the idea behind the meditation is that it must be accessible to kids as old as 10 years old. And if kids can do it and concentrate, then healthy adults should also be able to do it.
        </p>

        <h3>States of consciousness</h3>
        <p>
            If you know a bit about the project, then you might have heard about the vision of an enhanced communication system and problems of informational overwhelming, polluted media and overstimulation of the brain that my people can experience or already experienced in modern days.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vision of Monada Dominion is projecting and developing a system that is controlled by will, internal impulses, concentration and targeted attention. If you are in IT, you might see parallels with AI. It also uses attention to control certain things. Mind works in a similar way. Polluted media ecology can create depressed states of consciousness.
        </p>
        <p>
            What is consciousness? If you began with section 1 you'd know that there is a distinction between Being and existence. Consciousness is Being, while lack of it turns life into existence, without purpose, energy and motivation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, let's elevate this idea or get it to its critical state - objective consciousness. Assume, there are no secrets, no misunderstandings, no problems or boundaries in your vision and relations with the world and yourself. Clear and open flow of perception and understanding - mindfulness. This is what you will typically learn about mindfulness and meditation in relation to Buddhism, in Eastern or Western predominant tradition.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are states of consciousness and being. An ordinary human typically lives below their capacity and can get on a "higher level". This is true and nobody can argue that. Indeed, depression exists, anxiety exists, autism and death also exist. Obviously, even for the most ill people some improvement is possible. While for some it is death.
        </p>

        <h3>MD Multidimensional Meditation perspective</h3>
        <p>
            First of all, it is a very practical thing. It is more practical than theoretical. And the role of practice is superior to theoretical explanation here. Nevertheless, each step and substep have some text about the why, how, what and where to do the step.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mondada Dominion is a system, part of which is the conceptual philosophy of time with the same name. Conceptual philosophy of time imposes certain rules. These rules are derived from the heuristic visual pattern of the universal matrix. In this context, relevant rules are in the visual component. Symbols lead to something.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is not a state, not information, not a sensation and not a memory yet. Just something. All that is possible to say - the first symbol is the dot. And knowing a little about the meditation with the dot it is possible to conclude that the dot represents a clear flow of attention. Pure attention. Thus, the first symbol leads to the experience of clear flow of attention. Nothing else.
        </p>

        <h3>Differentiation</h3>
        <p>
            Is the state of meditation of a dot higher or lower than other states? It is an incorrect question. Further states with line, triangle and so on are not higher or lower than the dot. And this makes MD meditation different from typical other practices, where further advancement on the path indicates a higher state.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dot can be the highest and the lowest state. It is absolutely possible to achieve complete self realization of your all potential within the mediation with the dot. It is a complete and self sufficient practice. Possible to be performed in any situation in life. And if you share a vision of life after death of a physical body - this meditation is something for the afterworld as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, how to distinguish and differentiate other states? And why are they needed?
            First of all, development of a 12 step sequence is a natural process. The pattern is natural and self evident. This is how things happen in the universe - start, end, addition, division, higher frequencies, lower frequencies, time.
        </p>
        <p>
            If there is a dot, then there will be or can be all other 11 shapes of the universal matrix. Why? Let's say that if there is an observer, then there definitely will be all 12 steps. Since it is most closely resembling how attention and observation works. From the smallest glance or moment to a solid understanding and perception.
        </p>
        <p>
            In other words, you get an impression or an impulse, then you see something, then it is seen or perceived in another way - a memory is formatted. Like a stamp or a seal on the paper. If you've seen something, would you forget it right after? That happens quite often, but some things remain. There is more theory and questions about why and how memory works. The only thing needed - it works.
        </p>
        <p>
            Take two impressions, two memories and you have a connection. Only because you are the one remembering them. Self perception here will give a third dot if you recognise yourself. More and more can be said about the work of a 12 step sequence in the process of meaning extraction and system formation.
        </p>
        <p>
            What is important - initial moments or starting points are often different from middle and end of processes. Time goes in one direction in an ordinary perspective and linear world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Conceptual philosophy of time points to the idea of many parallel time flows, similarly to 4th paradigm for modelling and theoretical science. Here it is possible to interrupt and leave this part for theoretical exploration - return to section one and also read philosophy, engage in discussions about the theoretical part in our community.
        </p>
        <p>
            Things are too big, to put them here in the intro for meditation. In short, if you focus on a dot it is different from if you focus on a line. This difference is profound. It is not only on a visual or symbolic level, but also on a system level.
        </p>
        <p>
            Where is this system? According to universal matrix heuristic and conceptual philosophy it is possible to find the universal matrix anywhere. That is why it is called universal. More precisely, the universal matrix is a set of rules, which differentiate states and symbols and define them.
            You or any other human can experience it with meditation. It is easy to understand visual signals or other senses - see different symbols, hear different tones, touch one or many objects.
        </p>
        <p>
            With meditation one can receive a solid experience or a targeted experience. It can involve all human presence, body, memory, etc. or be a small sensation, a feeling or an insight.
        </p>
        <p>
            MD Multidimensional Meditation begins with attention, focus and relaxation. And provides a way to go through different levels of the universal matrix, which within this practice create different states of consciousness.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is possible to say that initially they can seem as a system of levels of different complexity, but when one level is mastered it becomes similar to others. Initially it is more difficult, because it requires more concentration points, but after it is mastered it becomes a heuristic in the brain with the symbol - a mental shortcut to a particular state. You already know how to get there and it is not more difficult than to relax or to do something simple.
