This repository houses Multidimensional Meditation materials for the **Monada Dominion** journey. Its purpose is to provide you with experience of different states of consciousness. The exercises and practices in this domain are designed to allow easy access to different states of focus and relaxation, complexities and depths. 

## 🗺️ Initial domains of Monada Dominion

It is a progressive journey structured into several domains. While you can explore some parts out of order, the intended path is designed for a gradual unfolding of understanding.

*   **🌀 Domain 1: The Dot - Mindfulness** (<a href="https://github.com/Monada-Dominion/domain_1">Link</a>)
    *   Essential preparation for the entire MD system - Shin-Lap mindfulness program.

*   **🧘‍♂️ Domain 2: The Line - Meditation** (You are here)
    *   Can be explored without preparation, but the need for theory from Domain 1 will emerge as you progress.

*   **🃏 Domain 3: The Triangel - Cards** (<a href="https://github.com/Monada-Dominion/domain_3">Link</a>)
    *   Will not fully reveal itself without completing Domains 1 and 2. However, it's always possible to create something new.

*   **🔒 Domain 4: The quadrangle - Algorithms**
    *   Not visible or available without the knowledge from all three preceding domains.

> Further steps are obscured but can be opened on demand. All currently available domains: (<a href="https://github.com/Monada-Dominion/domain_3">Link</a>)
