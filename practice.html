        <h2>2.1.2: Multidimensional Meditation - practice. The Dot & The Void</h2>

        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <p>
            Sit in a position that is comfortable for you to do the meditation. There are no restrictions here, you can sit on the floor with your legs crossed, your pelvis should be just above your feet. Or on a bench or chair, the main thing is to put your legs straight so that your knees are above your feet.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are sitting on a chair or on a bench, then place your hands on your knees or next to your legs on the side. Straighten up, but do not bend over too much - you should be relaxed and slightly tucked up, try not to feel tension at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Relax your back and relax all the muscles in your legs and arms, relax your facial expressions. Leave only a slight tone in the spine.
        </p>

        <h3>The Meditation</h3>
        <p>
            After that, start concentrating on the point or the dot. First, close your eyes and imagine that you are falling into emptiness or the void. Imagine or induce the sensation of falling, as if you are flying down.
        </p>
        <p>
            Think about when you might have jumped from a tower into the water or fell onto your bed. Imagine that you are falling and try to abandon the perception of yourself as a person outwardly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Begin to perceive yourself as a point in the void of the vast universe. Imagine that you are falling into a deep void. Somewhere, where there is nothing yet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Exhale and relax. Imagine that you are flying into the void. Apply a falling sensation to inhale. Connect your perception of yourself as a dot with the sensation of inhalation. With these sensations, try to feel infinity. That infinity that is hidden inside any abstract point.
        </p>
        <p>
            Imagine, and as you inhale, decrease this point more and more with each inhalation and exhalation. Try to reduce the point and find an even smaller point internally, and let this symbolize for you a fall into emptiness. You are no longer a human being, you are in the ocean of an endless universe.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meditate on this sensation - every breath you take makes the dot smaller and smaller. Feel deep relaxation along with the sensation of falling. Relax the muscles in your head, the muscles in your face, your neck.
        </p>
        <p>
            Go down to your chest, arms, abdomen, hip, legs, and eventually relax your entire body from crown to feet. With each inhalation and exhalation, relax and imagine that you are falling, falling into an endless void.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are a point that has neither dimensions nor coordinates. You are constantly falling into emptiness and you are constantly decreasing. You are your attention.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your attention is your concentration on this or that point, on this or that area of ​​life. The more you concentrate, the smaller the point you can find.
        </p>
        <p>
            The more scattered your attention, the wider your sphere will be - the sphere in which your attention is enclosed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once again, you are your attention. With every breath you fall into emptiness. Imagine that you are a point in an endless universe. Reduce the size of this point with each breath. Point and void are interconnected.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is infinity inside each point. We can never divide a point by the final smallest point. We can always find an even smaller unit and concentrate on it. Continue to decrease the point and your concentration will take on a whole new quality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Connect this point with the feeling of relaxation, with the feeling of falling oneself like a point in the ocean of the universe. Let the symbol of the point fix in your mind along with the feeling of falling, along with the feeling of falling into emptiness.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the feeling of losing the perception of oneself as a human form. Your consciousness is completely taken into account. You are your attention, which is directed to a point that falls into an endless void, which has no size and which is constantly decreasing.
        </p>
        <p>
            This first exercise is related to the first stage of multidimensional void-point meditation.
