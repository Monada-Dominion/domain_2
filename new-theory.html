        <h2>2.1.4: Multidimensional Meditation - Questions. Dot and Void</h2>

        <h3>Advanced questions</h3>
        <p>
            These questions must elevate your mind from ordinary perspective and help to exit logical cell. Overcome yourself with these extra questions.
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>What is the dot?</li>
            <li>What happens when you do meditation? Is it attention, mind or anything else that tries to find the smallest dot?</li>
            <li>Are you able to clear your mind and body from any associations, visual attachments, senses or perception of the process of moving to the smallest dot?</li>
            <li>Can you attain the state of complete unity with your meditation practice? Are you able to be one with this exercise?</li>
            <li>Can you recognise the connection between card 1 in step 1 and card 1 in step 2? Can you achieve genuine critical thinking and successfully practice this meditation exercise?</li>
            <li>If not, what is blocking you? And how to overcome it?</li>
            <li>What is the void?</li>
            <li>What is there beyond the void? What is there, where your attention is not present? Is there a smallest dot somewhere, or is there another moving attention?</li>
        </ul>
