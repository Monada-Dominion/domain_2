# 2.1.4 Multidimensional Meditation â€“ Questions

## Dot and Void

---

### Advanced Questions

These questions must elevate your mind from an ordinary perspective and help you exit the logical cell. Overcome yourself with these extra questions:

- **What is the dot?**
- What happens when you do meditation? Is it attention, mind, or anything else that tries to find the smallest dot?
- Are you able to clear your mind and body from any associations, visual attachments, senses, or perception of the process of moving to the smallest dot?
- Can you attain the state of complete unity with your meditation practice? Are you able to be one with this exercise?
- Can you recognize the connection between card 1 in step 1 and card 1 in step 2? Can you achieve genuine critical thinking and successfully practice this meditation exercise?
- If not, what is blocking you? And how to overcome it?
- **What is the void?**
- What is there beyond the void? What is there, where your attention is not present? Is there a smallest dot somewhere, or is there another moving attention?
