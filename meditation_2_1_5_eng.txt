Multidimensional Meditation - Practice - The Point as an Independent Element

In the previous stage, you became acquainted with the foundation of multidimensional meditation - the point and the void.
Perhaps this single exercise is enough to comprehend infinity.

Everything that follows is advanced work.

However, realizing this, as well as the infinite depth of the first stage, is quite challenging.
And it is possible that this knowledge and experience may elude you.

Following the logic of the universal matrix, progression develops, and the complexity of the system increases.

The point, a unit that has neither size nor coordinates, is the closest step to the void.

It can be said that with the first exercise, you became acquainted with the void.

Where is this point? What is it? Where is the smallest element, the atom?

If you did everything correctly, you immersed yourself in an infinite flow.

This flow is pure attention. Again, if you did everything correctly, you managed to purify the flow of attention from anything else.
And you experienced attention as such. Practically. As a physical substance. You separated it from the body.

Continuing this practice leads to liberation from influences, memory, and external impacts.
You simply remain in infinite movement toward the smallest object, which can never be reached.

I think it is worth dedicating more time to this exercise. Do not rush forward.
You can spend several years on just the point and the void.

I use it constantly. Practically, I never move forward. I have performed the entire meditation only a few times in my life.
And I am convinced that it is enough to perform all the stages or at least half of them once to forever change your perception of reality.

It cannot be said that this is canonical enlightenment. But it is too different from anything that can be encountered in ordinary life.

If you still decide to continue now, here is what you need to know from the theory for the next exercise.

The steps represent stages or foundations of discernment. These are different states that form the possibility or ability to discern.

The meditation presented here is a tool for learning states of consciousness.
Through exercises and symbols, the ability to distinguish, memorize, recall, and even transmit them to others emerges.

The meditation is called multidimensional. And the first few dimensions are hidden in the first stage - the point.

The point and the void are one dimension and state.
The point as an independent element is another.
The point and the line are the third.

The second exercise affirms the point. The perception of the point as an independent unit is enhanced.

Infinite movement and falling into the void, as the perception of one's pure attention, are replaced by the densification of attention.
Concentration is the most appropriate word.

Instead of detached observation, concentration is practiced. Instead of dissolution, presence.

This contrast allows one to see the multidimensional nature of what seems to be the simplest element - the point.

Nevertheless, the experience is much more complex, and its comprehension requires time and discipline.

Therefore, it is suggested to dedicate much more time to the first exercise.

The more I practice this, the less desire I have to do anything else. I am inclined to believe that the point alone is sufficient.
And everyone is capable of growing their own tree and building a harmonious system.

The rules of the universal matrix are natural and built on the logic of least action and greatest clarity.
Following this path, any practitioner is highly likely to achieve the same or similar result.
