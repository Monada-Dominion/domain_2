# 2.2.3 Multidimensional Meditation – Reflection

## Movement on the Line — Reflection

Use these prompts after practicing the "Movement of a point along a line" stage (2.2.1–2.2.2) to deepen your understanding and track your progress.

### Immediate Practice Notes
- Session rhythm: How did you structure the alternation between "falling into void" and "filled presence"? What was the duration for each state (e.g., 3 seconds each)?
- Quality of movement: Did the transition between points feel like a smooth flow, a discrete jump, or something else?
- Body sensations: Where in your body did you feel the "line"? Did the sensation of movement have a physical correlate?

### Observing the Flow
- Binary code analogy: Did the concept of two alternating states creating a line resonate with you? Describe any insights or difficulties with this model.
- Sense of time: How did this practice affect your perception of time? Did it feel sped up, slowed down, or more granular?
- Attention stability: Was it easier to maintain focus while actively moving attention along the line, compared to holding a static point?

### Integration & Practical Use
- Apply the concept: Identify a sequence of tasks in your day (e.g., making breakfast). Can you frame it as a "line" composed of discrete "points" of action? Does this change your experience of the task?
- Micro-test: When feeling overwhelmed by a process, pause for 1 minute. Visualize the process as a line. Focus only on the very next "point" or step. Did this bring clarity?

### Signs of Progress
- A growing sense of continuity and flow between discrete moments of attention.
- Increased ability to see daily life events as a sequence of interconnected points on a line.
- Less mental friction when switching between different states of focus.

### Troubleshooting & Adjustments
- If the movement feels chaotic: Slow down the switching time. Increase the duration you spend on each point to 5-10 seconds before alternating.
- If the concept feels too abstract: Use a physical anchor. For example, tap one finger for the "void" state and another for the "presence" state as you alternate.
- If you lose the feeling of the line: Pause the movement and re-establish the two end-points first. Feel the static connection before trying to move between them again.
