# 2.1.1 Multidimensional Meditation – Theory

## Dot & Void

---

Welcome to the second domain of **Monada Dominion**: *Multidimensional Meditation*.

> By now you could have already completed the first section – **Mindfulness & Mindfitness**. You might have done various exercises and practices with attention, goal setting, and concentration. This will be helpful for you on this journey. The more you gained from the first section, the more you will understand in the second.

However, the first section is **not obligatory** or necessary to do this meditation. Moreover, it is not even necessary to follow the default order – you are free to pick up any card with any step of meditation.

It was designed to provide immediate access to particular states arranged or tied to the order of the universal matrix. Yet, it seems logical and correct to go step by step and gradually explore states.

## Why do this meditation?

- If you **don’t know what meditation is**, this is the right place to find out.
- If you **already have experience**, you might enrich it with this original practice.

The reason to do it – and most importantly to complete all steps – is an **elegant and intuitive system of navigation in the space of different states of consciousness**. Practically, each step is tied to a different state of consciousness, and meditation teaches to identify and differentiate them.

While the **visual heuristic of the universal matrix** serves as a system of portals or keys that allow quick and targeted state access.

> In two words: you remember symbols and enter specific states.

Of course, this is highly dependent on your skill. For some people it might be slower, more difficult, or not work at all.

Yet, the idea behind the meditation is that it must be **accessible to kids as young as 10 years old**. And if kids can do it and concentrate, then healthy adults should also be able to do it.

## States of Consciousness

If you know a bit about the project, then you might have heard about the vision of an **enhanced communication system** and problems of informational overwhelming, polluted media, and overstimulation of the brain that many people can experience or already experienced in modern days.

The vision of Monada Dominion is projecting and developing a system that is **controlled by will, internal impulses, concentration, and targeted attention**.

If you are in IT, you might see parallels with AI. It also uses attention to control certain things. Mind works in a similar way.

> Polluted media ecology can create depressed states of consciousness.

### What is consciousness?

If you began with section 1 you’d know that there is a distinction between **Being** and **existence**.

- **Consciousness is Being**, while lack of it turns life into existence, without purpose, energy, and motivation.

Then, let’s elevate this idea or get it to its critical state – **objective consciousness**.

Assume, there are no secrets, no misunderstandings, no problems or boundaries in your vision and relations with the world and yourself. Clear and open flow of perception and understanding – **mindfulness**.

This is what you will typically learn about mindfulness and meditation in relation to Buddhism, in Eastern or Western predominant tradition.

There are states of consciousness and being. An ordinary human typically lives below their capacity and can get on a “higher level”.
