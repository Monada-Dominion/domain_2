# 2.1.7 Multidimensional Meditation – Reflection

## Dot and Void — Reflection

Use these prompts after completing stages 2.1.1 through 2.1.6 to solidify your experience, notice change over time, and plan next steps.

### Immediate Practice Reflection
- How long did you sit and practice the dot/void exercise today? Note the start and end time.
- What bodily sensations did you notice before, during and after the practice (tension, warmth, lightness, sinking, floating)?
- Describe your dominant quality of attention during the session (scattered, steady, bright, dull, sinking, expansive).
- Did the sense of falling into the void feel more like loss or release? How did that emotion change the practice?

### Mental & Emotional Observations
- Which thoughts repeated most often? Were you able to notice them without following them?
- Did any memories, images or narratives appear when the point became very small? How did you respond to them?
- After the practice, how would you rate your mood, clarity, and energy on a 1–10 scale? Record daily to see trends.

### Signs of Progress (what to watch for)
- Longer periods where attention rests on a smaller point without getting pulled away.
- Reduced reactivity after the practice (less urgent or automatic emotional response).
- Easier relaxation of facial and neck muscles when entering the dot/void.
- Ability to switch from the falling/void sensation to the filled-point (independent point) with intention.

### Integration & Application
- Where in your day can you recall the point/void sensation (walking, waiting, brief pauses)? Try 1–3 micro-practices.
- Choose one daily activity (e.g., washing hands, making tea). Before starting, locate the dot for 10–20 seconds.
- Use the filled-point visualization for 3 breaths when you need presence and the void-fall for 3 breaths when you need release.

### Troubleshooting & Edge Cases
- If your mind races: shorten the practice to 3–5 minutes and stabilize with breath counting.
- If the practice becomes drowsy: open eyes slightly, lift posture, or switch from void to filled-point imagery.
- If strong emotions surface: acknowledge them, allow space, and after the session write one sentence describing the feeling.

### Short Journal Template (post-practice)
- Date / Duration: 
- Sensations remembered in order (body → breath → mind): 
- One insight or surprise from today: 
- One concrete action to try before the next session: 

Spend a moment reading your last 3 entries before beginning a new session; notice patterns and refine intent.
