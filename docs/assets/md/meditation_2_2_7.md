# 2.2.7 Multidimensional Meditation – Reflection

## The Line as an Independent Element — Reflection

Use these prompts after practicing with the line as a singular, independent entity (2.2.5–2.2.6) to analyze your experience and guide your next steps.

### Immediate Practice Notes
- Session focus: Did you concentrate on the bidirectional movement, the "stretching" sensation, or holding multiple points of attention at once?
- Dominant sensation: Describe the primary feeling of the line. Was it tension, flow, expansion, a pathway, or something else?
- Body anchors: Which physical sensations were most helpful for grounding the practice (e.g., the breath expanding the chest, the feeling of gravity, the spine's axis)?

### Quality of Movement & The Infinite
- Bidirectional flow: Did you feel the movement as two distinct streams going in opposite directions from a central point, or as a single entity expanding outwards?
- The "stretching" metaphor: Did the image of a stretching tourniquet resonate? Where in your body did you feel this tension or expansion?
- Approaching infinity: The practice suggests we can't "think" our way to infinity but can experience it. Did you have moments where the intellectual effort dropped away, leaving only the sensation of endless movement? Describe one.

### Holding Multiple Attentions
- If you practiced holding three points of attention (void-point, presence-point, and the line), how did you distribute your focus? Was it 33% on each, or did your attention shift between them?
- Did the different elements interact? For example, did feeling the line *change* the experience of the points?
- What was the biggest challenge in this multi-focus practice? Was it maintaining clarity, avoiding distraction, or something else?

### Integration & Practical Use
- **Axis awareness:** Throughout your day, notice the primary axes of your movement (forward/backward, up/down). Can you bring the sensation of the "line" into a simple action like walking or standing up?
- **Emotional spectrum:** View a strong emotion as a line with two opposite poles (e.g., joy/sadness). Can you feel the entire line at once, rather than just being at one end of it?
- **Micro-practice:** For one minute, sit and feel your breath not just as in/out, but as a line expanding and contracting from your center.

### Troubleshooting & Adjustments
- If the bidirectional movement feels confusing: Simplify. Focus only on one direction (a "ray") for a few minutes before adding the second.
- If holding multiple attentions is overwhelming: Practice with just two elements (e.g., void-point and the line) before adding the third.
- If the concept feels too abstract: Use a stronger physical anchor. While breathing, physically stretch your arms out to the sides to mimic the line's expansion.

- One insight about the nature of movement or infinity: 
- One adjustment for next time (e.g., focus more on breath, try a different axis):
