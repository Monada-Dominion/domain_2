# 2.2.1 Multidimensional Meditation - Theory - Movement of a point along a line, a line as a set of points

This stage of multidimensional meditation is dedicated to the point and the line.

In the previous stages, we examined such states as the point and the void, the point as an independent element, and the point in connection with the line.

This stage is dedicated to the movement of a point along a line.

You can quickly recall how for the first time the point infinitely decreased, plunged into the void, after which we filled it with our presence, our sense of presence. After that, we developed the perception and duality of these two sensations, inhale-exhale, different sensations. And when you enter meditation, when you are already in it, concentrate on the line and on the idea that it consists of an infinite number of points.

Think about the fact that at every moment in time you perceive a large number of impressions from the surrounding world. Imagine that your impressions are alternately reduced either to a point that falls into the void, or to the feeling of filling the point with your presence.

Either you fall somewhere and infinitely decrease, or you fill this moment of time with your presence.

And so, like a binary code, you have only two states. They follow one after another alternately and create a line from these different states.
