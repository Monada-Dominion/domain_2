# 2.1.10 Multidimensional Meditation – Practice - The Point and The Line

For this, as always, sit comfortably, relax, perform some breathing exercises. With each inhale, breathe in relaxation, and with each exhale, breathe out tension. Sit like that for three to five minutes. Just breathe.

Shift your attention around your body so as to release all muscle tension. Do this with the inhale and the exhale. If you find tension somewhere, breathe a little imagining that your inhale descends into your arm, into your abdomen. Allow the air and its energy to take that tension away and remove it together with the breath.

When you have reached a state of relaxation, begin again to imagine yourself as a point. Sink a little into the sensation of infinite diminution and falling into the void. Stay in it, then stop it. Look at yourself as a point in the boundless Universe of other possibilities, located at the center of three axes. Fill this point with your sense of presence.

Now become aware that besides you there is another point. If earlier we spoke about three axes, then at minimum a position not at the center of the three axes, their intersection, but on one of the axes — above or slightly to the side, or below — is already a second point. But you enter it when you look at yourself from the outside.

Last time, when we tried to be aware of the point as an independent element, as the possibility of something’s existence, we imagined ourselves as a sphere and looked from somewhere far away. Accordingly, from the vantage point from which we looked at ourselves, we created a line, because we were also present there. And the connection between these two points is a line.

For a person, abstract forms of concentration are very useful, but at the same time they are unattainable. We can strive for them, but it is very difficult for us to reach a complete state of detachment and merge with some abstract archetype or pattern in the form of a figure.

When we think about a point, there is the mind, there is the element that watches everything, and there is the object of concentration, the point. There is the subject — that which watches it, the mind — and it creates the line. The aim of multidimensional meditation is to unite all of this, to unify the object, the subject, and other elements of human being. Our other states of consciousness, our other perceptual tools that exist within us — such as the mind, feelings, sensations — to combine all this into a single holistic structure and in the future to manage our state of consciousness, our level of concentration, immersion within ourselves by means of the figures of the universal matrix.

Accordingly, everything starts from the point, and the line is the exit, it is the possibility to reach something greater and to understand it. In this case we must compare the point and the line, how strongly they differ. When we think of the point and try to concentrate on it, we gather all our energy into this point, or we direct all our attention toward developing the sensation of falling, toward cultivating the feeling and perception of the idea of an infinitely diminishing point.

If you initially see a point of certain dimensions, then this is no longer a point but a sphere or a circle; in the first stage you constantly reduce it, bringing everything to a smaller and smaller point. And besides the reduction this is still constantly falling somewhere.

If this is a plane and the point is of some size, then we reduce it, constantly descending somewhere. The line in this case can be realized precisely through the possibility of understanding and noticing the presence of your mind, the presence of some observer who watches all this and gives commands to visualize and imagine these figures. And this is another point; in it one can also sink into the void or fill it with one’s presence, but it will possess a different quality.

If the first point is a passive object that we create, then the second point is that which creates, that which already exists and creates this first point. Moreover, the line also cannot be fully comprehended by us, since it consists of an infinite number of points, of a huge number of these points that have neither size nor coordinates. And we cannot be aware of each of them. Therefore, concentration on the line allows one to realize multiplicity. One could say that it was already present in the very first meditation, when we were diminishing. And this process of diminution in time represents a narrowing line.

Also our states of consciousness, our capabilities of concentration, and what they are directed at are different. When we are just entering meditation — that is one state. When we concentrate on the point and the void — another state. When we concentrate on the point as the possibility of something’s existence — a third state.

Coming to the awareness of the existence of a line of different states of consciousness, we arrive at a fourth state, and there are many of them. And all of them can be united into a line, within which we can be sequentially. In some of these points we may be, or simultaneously in two points where one observes the other. Or somehow we combine different states of consciousness.

So, in this meditation the main task is to realize yourself as a point in the void: a point and the void, a point constantly diminishing and falling somewhere, collapsing. And at the same time to be aware of yourself as an individuality in the boundless ocean of possibilities, to be aware of yourself as the observer, to be aware of yourself as a point filled with your presence, and to hold both of these states.

Try it now. Begin with the state of infinite falling. As if to trigger it so that it repeats, like a looping video. Only this is not a video, but something more, like your sensation. And at the same time begin to hold the sensation of your state of presence inside that sphere which we see from afar. From above.

Inhale and you are the point plunging into the void. Exhale and you are the point filled with presence. Inhale and exhale. The possibility of something existing. You are the point filled with presence. Exhale — you are the infinitely diminishing point, collapsing into the infinite void.
