## 2.1.9 Multidimensional Meditation – Theory – The Point and The Line (A Possibility and a Probability of the Possibility)

This meditation is devoted to the relationship between the point and the line. In the previous two stages we practiced the meditation Point and Void and the Point as a standalone element. In the first case we immersed ourselves in the process of infinite diminution of perception — as close as possible to the sensation of the awareness of an abstract point.

You can recall that sensation. Before moving to the next stage, it is good to remember the previous ones. Everything begins with renouncing perceiving yourself as a person and reducing the sensation of your presence to some abstract point. But before that, of course, we take the correct posture and relax.

So, the very first exercise is to imagine yourself as a point, infinitely falling somewhere into the void. Understand that with the mind we cannot imagine a real point. It is an abstract idea. We always imagine a point with some size and coordinates. In reality, a true point cannot possess size or coordinates. Therefore, at first we constantly make this point smaller, we immerse ourselves in some point, making it smaller and smaller, smaller and smaller.

More precisely, it is not only the point itself, but the object of your mental concentration, your focus, that we make smaller. Through this infinite diminution we arrive at the awareness of the point and the void.

There is a point. There is that on which we concentrate. There is the void — this is the infinite division of that point into smaller parts.

The next stage of multidimensional meditation is the awareness of the point as an independent unit and the point as the possibility of an event’s existence. And the point as the possibility of an event’s existence already elevates us, on the contrary, somewhere upward, where we look at ourselves as a kind of sphere that we are inside.

From afar or from a very great height we see ourselves as a point. Here the task, on the contrary, is to fill this point with your presence, to feel the fullness of your individuality and your presence inside this point amid the boundless universe of other points and other possibilities.

At this stage the point appears as the possibility of something existing — in this case, life and the states of a person. 

In this new step we need to realize the point in relation to the line. Line consists of numerous points. 

You should have some perspective on the point. Initial Point and the Void exercise represents the possibility for any event to appear. 

Second practice with presence manifestation represents the probability of any event. 

Basically, infinite void shows us the infinite pool of possibilities. However, their probabilities may be zero. 

When manifesting the presence in now or concentrating energy in one point the probability raises. This turns from void into something present and manifested. 

Expand these ideas with a new exercise.
