# 2.1.3 Multidimensional Meditation – Reflection

## Dot and Void

---

Reflect on the **theory** and **practice** of the first step of Multidimensional Meditation.

---

### Theory
- **Why are you here?**
- **Why do meditation?**
- **How to identify your progress or assess the direction of movement?**

---

### Practice
- **Relaxation, finding space**
- Can you do it on the go?
- Is it hard to direct the mind? Or is it a relaxing moment for you?

---

### Practice Reflection & Integration
- Duration & rhythm: How long did you practice today and was your attention steady, wavering, or changing quality over time?
- Sensory register: Which senses (body sensations, sounds, images) were most present during the dot/void work?
- Emotion & tone: Did the session bring calm, agitation, curiosity, sadness, or something else? Where was that experienced in the body?
- Stability test: After the session, could you hold the dot for a few seconds at will? If yes, how long? If no, what pulled you away?

### Signs of Subtle Change
- You can find stillness in shorter periods (10–30s) with less effort.
- You experience less identification with passing thoughts during the practice.
- The sense of falling into void becomes less frightening and more neutral or liberating.

### Micro-practices to Try
- During a 2-minute pause in your day: close your eyes and locate the dot for 30 seconds; note one change.
- If distracted: label the distraction (thought, sound, itch) and return to the dot without judgment.
- Alternate: 1 minute void (falling) → 1 minute dot-as-presence, repeat 3 times and notice which mode feels more stabilizing.

### Troubleshooting
- Overwhelm or agitation: shorten the practice, place hands on the belly to ground, focus on breath for 6 breaths, then return to the dot.
- Sleepiness: practice sitting with open eyes on a soft focus; switch to filled-point visualization.
- Persistent narratives: write one line immediately after the session to discharge the story, then resume practice later.

### Short Journal Prompt (after practice)
- Date / Duration: 
- Dominant sensation (body → breath → mind): 
- One insight or obstacle: 
- Tiny experiment for next session (time/technique): 

Review your previous 3 entries before starting a new session to notice trajectories and refine intention.
