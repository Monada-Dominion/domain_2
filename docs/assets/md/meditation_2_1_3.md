Reflect on the **theory** and **practice** of the first step of Multidimensional Meditation.

### Theory
- **Why are you here?**
- **Why do meditation?**
- **How to identify your progress or assess the direction of movement?**

### Practice
- **Relaxation, finding space**
- Can you do it on the go?
- Is it hard to direct the mind? Or is it a relaxing moment for you?
