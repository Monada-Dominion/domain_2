# 2.1.11 Multidimensional Meditation – Reflection

## Point and Line — Reflection

Use these prompts after practicing the Point-and-Line stage (2.1.9–2.1.10) to integrate insights and plan next steps.

### Immediate Practice Notes
- Session duration and rhythm: How long did you practice and did you alternate falling/void and filled-point consciously?
- Transition quality: Was the shift between "falling into void" and "filled presence" smooth, jarring, or mixed?
- Body signals: Where in the body did you notice the line-forming sense (a pull, a thread, a spatial shift)?

### Observing Multiplicity
- Did you notice a sense of more than one perspective (being in two points at once, observer and observed)? Describe briefly.
- When you imagined the line connecting two points, did your attention expand across the imagined span or remain located at one pole?

### Integration & Practical Use
- Apply a short practice: before a meeting, do 3 cycles of (inhale: falling/void → exhale: filled-point). Note whether you feel more grounded or more diffused.
- Micro-test: During a 1-minute pause, locate yourself as the filled-point, then imagine a second point and trace a line to it. How quickly can you alternate roles (observer ↔ observed)?

### Signs of Progress
- Easier intentional switching between modes (void ↔ presence) without losing balance.
- Feeling multiple perspectives without stress — noticing rather than reacting to multiplicity.
- Increased ability to map internal states as spatial relations (point, line, plane) during daily life.

### Troubleshooting & Adjustments
- If the line feels confusing or fragmented: slow down and practice a single, slow inhalation/exhalation cycle for each mode.
- If emotional content arises when connecting points (old memories, regrets), pause the exercise and use grounding breathwork or write a one-line note after the session.
- If you lose the sense of the point while tracing lines, return to the filled-point for 30s to stabilize.

### Short Journal Template (post-session)
- Date / Duration: 
- Dominant experience (void/falling / filled-point / line): 
- One insight about multiplicity or perspective: 
- One micro-experiment to try next time: 

Compare entries across sessions to see if your capacity to sustain two perspectives or move along a line is increasing.
