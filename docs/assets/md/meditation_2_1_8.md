# 2.1.8 Multidimensional Meditation – Questions

## Dot and Void — Deeper Questions

Use these questions to extend reflection, inspire further practice, and test the coherence of your experience across stages.

### Foundational Inquiry
- What felt most real during the practice: the sensation of falling, the tiny point you observed, or the feeling of attention itself? Why?
- Can you identify a qualitative difference between the dot as emptiness (void) and the dot as presence (filled-point)? Describe both.

### Attention and Identity
- When attention narrows to the smallest point, where is the sense of "I" located? Does it shift, shrink, or dissolve?
- If attention is the primary object, what remains of memory, narrative, and self-image during deep concentration?

### Practical Experiment Questions
- Try alternating 1 minute void (falling) + 1 minute filled-point (presence) for five rounds. Which mode stabilizes attention faster?
- During daily life, can you intentionally shrink your attention for 10 seconds before reacting? Track successful attempts in a week.

### Advanced Philosophical Prompts
- If every point contains infinity, how does this change your view of scarcity, limits, and possibility?
- Is the void a space of absence or a reservoir of potential? Defend your answer with personal experience from practice.

### Integration Challenges
- What habitual thought patterns or sensory attachments consistently disrupt your ability to maintain the dot? List three and propose one micro-solution for each.
- How will you adapt the practice if you have only 1 minute, 5 minutes, or 30 minutes? Write a short protocol for each duration.

### Continuing Development
- Choose one question above and convert it into a two-week experiment with measurable checkpoints (e.g., frequency of successful 10s attention holds, mood scores, or muscle relaxation).
- After two weeks, review your journal entries and answer: What changed? What stayed the same? What will you change next?

These questions are intentionally both practical and provocative — use them to deepen skill, curiosity, and honest self-observation.
