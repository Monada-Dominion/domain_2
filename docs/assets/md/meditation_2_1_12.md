# 2.1.12 Multidimensional Meditation – Questions

## Point and Line — Deeper Questions

Use these questions to probe the relationship between singularity (point) and multiplicity/sequentiality (line). They are designed to deepen practice and spark experiments.

### Core Inquiry
- How does the experience of a single filled-point change when you intentionally create a connecting line to another point?
- Is the line merely an abstract connection or does it carry a different quality of attention (movement, narrative, causality)?

### Attention & Perspective Experiments
- Alternating experiment: Practice 1 minute of pure falling-void, then 1 minute of filled-point, then 1 minute of tracing a line between two imagined points. Which mode feels most stable?
- Perspective swap: While tracing a line, imagine swapping positions with the other point. What changes in felt experience and narrative?

### Practical / Daily Integration
- Where in your life does attention usually form lines (task sequences, conversations, planning)? Choose one and test applying a short point-line practice before engaging.
- Can you use the line-visualization as an interruption technique—trace a line for 10s when you notice automatic reactivity? Record results for 7 days.

### Philosophical Prompts
- If a line is many points, and each point contains infinity, what does that suggest about causality and continuity in experience?
- Does recognizing multiplicity (the line) reduce the solidity of the self or increase the capacity to hold others' perspectives? Reflect with an example.

### Challenges to Explore
- When the line feels overwhelming (too many perspectives), how can you prioritize which points to attend to? List 3 criteria (urgency, ethics, clarity, kindness, etc.).
- If attention fractures when you imagine multiple points, try limiting to two and gradually increase; note threshold moments where fragmentation begins.

Use these questions to design short experiments (3–14 days) and measure simple outcomes: frequency of successful perspective swaps, subjective clarity, emotional reactivity before/after practice.
