# 2.1.4 Multidimensional Meditation – Questions

## Dot and Void

---

### Advanced Questions

These questions must elevate your mind from an ordinary perspective and help you exit the logical cell. Overcome yourself with these extra questions:

- **What is the dot?**
- What happens when you do meditation? Is it attention, mind, or anything else that tries to find the smallest dot?
- Are you able to clear your mind and body from any associations, visual attachments, senses, or perception of the process of moving to the smallest dot?
- Can you attain the state of complete unity with your meditation practice? Are you able to be one with this exercise?
- Can you recognize the connection between card 1 in step 1 and card 1 in step 2? Can you achieve genuine critical thinking and successfully practice this meditation exercise?
- If not, what is blocking you? And how to overcome it?
- **What is the void?**
- What is there beyond the void? What is there, where your attention is not present? Is there a smallest dot somewhere, or is there another moving attention?

### Deepening Prompts & Experiments
- Compare experiences: Spend one session focusing only on the falling-void and one session on the filled-point; write which produced more clarity or release.
- Probe identity: During a short practice, ask "Who perceives the dot?" and simply note the first three impressions that arise.
- Border test: Visualize the sphere (from 2.1.6), then from above watch it shrink into a point; notice if anything is lost or gained in meaning.

### Integration Questions
- When in daily life do you instinctively reach for expansion (void) versus contraction (filled-point)? How can you balance both intentionally?
- What small ritual (3–5 breaths) will you attach to the practice to bring it into daily moments (e.g., before eating, entering a meeting)?

### Philosophical & Practical Challenges
- Is the dot a limit or a gateway? Consider a personal example where narrowing attention opened a new possibility.
- If attention is the substrate of experience, how should you care for it in the context of media, work, and relationships?

Use these questions to create short experiments (1–14 days) and track simple metrics: number of successful 10-second holds, subjective clarity score (1–10), or emotion shifts after practice.
