# 2.2.2 Multidimensional Meditation - Practice - Movement of a point along a line, a line as a set of points

Immerse yourself in your presence, in the awareness of your attention as an abstract, fluid energy.

To do this, first relax, as always.

Start from the crown of your head, with your facial expressions, with the inside of your head.

Go down through your whole body, breathe, breathe through all the tensions.

Let them go.

Inhale relaxation, exhale tension. And after you have relaxed your whole body, from the crown of your head to the tips of your heels, and you need to bring this relaxation down there, begin to fill your body with attention, as if you are filling it with warm oil, a warm liquid. As if your attention is pouring into your feet and so it rises and you feel the rise from your feet to your knees, from your knees to your pelvis, from your pelvis to your stomach, from your stomach to your chest, from your chest to your neck, into your arms.

And in the end, a certain quality of attention fills your head and your whole body.

Now your body is relaxed and filled with sensations.

And this is the energy of sensations, the energy of attention.

And this energy of sensation, the energy of attention, which you can imagine as a liquid filling your body, distribute it along a line of two states.

A line consisting of an infinite fall and holding attention on a point.

How to do it? And hold your attention on the point?

I have already said that this line needs to be imagined or visualized. Just a certain segment.

And start moving your attention from one state to another.

For three seconds you fall, for three seconds you fill the point with your presence.

Do not forget to be far enough away from yourself.

And to a greater extent, concentrate on abstract sensations, on the abstract idea of all this, and not just on images. Of much greater importance in this meditation is the state, which is indicated by figures, and the figures are like keys that allow you to penetrate into this state.

I give only a few key states associated with the point, with the line, with other figures. You can find many more of them, and they are all alternately, in stages, gradually present in our lives, but in different ways.

It is thanks to multidimensional meditation, thanks to this change of archetypes, this change of states, that you can deeply immerse yourself in the philosophy of time, to realize time as a crystal, consisting of archetypes of the flow of time, constantly replacing each other.

So, your attention, directed sometimes to the point and the void, sometimes to an independent point, sometimes to a point reflecting the possibility of the existence of something, sometimes to two points at the same time. All this is the flow of time passing through you, expressed in the form of your attention, in the form of your concentration.

This flow ultimately represents a certain segment. If you thought about it, concentrated on another state, on a third, on a fourth.

Trying to combine everything together, you get a line. It will be difficult for us to hold 456 points or 1000 at once.

But for a start, switch between them, as if you are changing channels on the TV, flipping through videos on YouTube. Switch from one idea to another and hold your attention on each for three seconds. A second to inhale, a second to absorb oxygen, a second to exhale.

Absorption is the interval between inhalation and exhalation.

Let's try.

1. A point infinitely decreasing and falling into the void.

2. A point as the possibility of the existence of an event, filled with your sense of your own presence.

3. A point and a line or two points of a different kind at the same time.

4. Moving between points.

6. Again a point and a void.

7. A point.

8. A point and a line.

9. A line. Movement along a line. A line.

10. Movement along a line.

11. Movement of a point along a line.

12. Movement of another point along a line.

You can continue this exercise in a free sequence.
Moving attention along a line between points and concentrating on the line as such, consisting of many points.
