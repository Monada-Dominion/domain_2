# 2.2.5 Multidimensional Meditation - Practice - The Line as an Independent Element

This stage of multidimensional meditation is dedicated to the line as an independent element.

In the previous stages, we immersed ourselves in the awareness and feeling of the point as an abstract idea, as an abstract figure.

It all began with its rethinking, with immersing ourselves in the idea that we cannot fully comprehend an abstract point with our minds, that we will always be looking for a smaller figure, a smaller size of it.

This also connected it with the void, that we are infinitely falling there.

After that, we filled this point with our presence, moved to the macro level, where our state, our life, like a kind of sphere, was filled with our sensation and was also reduced to a point. After that, we moved on to the awareness of the point and the line. When it was necessary to realize the difference between these two figures, it was necessary to understand the movement along these figures before the beginning of today's stage.

Before the beginning of today's stage, The Line as an Independent Figure, quickly scroll through all the previous phases in your memory.

Let's focus on the point, on its infinite decrease, on filling the point with our presence, our sense of presence, the sensation of our body, our mind.

Let's move on to comparing the point and the line.

The fact that a point is one of the possibilities for the existence of something.
Each point denotes the possibility of the existence of something.

A line is a multitude of different possibilities combined into a structure.

And you can perceive the two extreme points in a line as a segment.
You can move along this line, as you move through states.

And today it is important to immerse yourself in the perception of the line as an independent figure.

And this is also directly related to the awareness of movement, but it will not be just a switch between different states, but something new.

And so sit comfortably and relax.

Relax your whole body from the crown of your head to the tips of your toes, after which try to fill your body with sensation, raise the sensation from your heels to the crown of your head, fill the body with presence, move away from the perception of yourself as a person.

Reduce the perception of yourself to the perception of a point in the boundless universe of possibilities.

Look at yourself from afar and see yourself simply as a point against the background of this whole infinitely large ensemble of forms and figures.

Now the point appears from the intersection of the axes. The axes of coordinates and possibilities of movement. Well, this is movement up, movement down, movement away from yourself, towards yourself, to the right or to the left.

Maybe somewhere else diagonally.

It all starts with a point located at the intersection of these axes.

Choose one of the axes and start moving along this axis in two directions.

This will allow us to understand the line.

For example, I will take the vertical axis.

Upward movement.

It can also have a symbolic meaning, like some kind of spiritual ascent. And accordingly, concentrate on the idea of simultaneous movement in two directions, as if a kind of tourniquet is being stretched.

This movement in two directions also occurs with inhalation and exhalation. Inhale and you have slightly moved this line apart, lengthened it. Exhale and you have lengthened it even more.

Inhale, exhale.

If in the past it was necessary to concentrate on different states of the point, which formed a line, now this movement goes in two directions.

This movement, this flow can be felt in different ways.

The first thing we did was the sensation of falling. Close your eyes, relax.

Feel how you are falling into the void, how the division of matter or the reduction of matter to a point is infinitely decreasing deep inside yourself into some atomic, subatomic structure. This is one of the possibilities to feel this movement.

Another movement is breathing.

Breathing, the air that comes into contact with the walls of our internal organs, also forms this movement.

And the sensations of the flow of air and resistance to this air or friction against the walls of internal organs, movement through the body with the blood can serve as starting points for the perception of a line as movement simultaneously in two directions.

If we take it geometrically, then a segment is a limited line between two points.

A ray is an infinite line from one point in one direction.

And a line is movement in two directions and it is infinite.

And how to realize this with the mind?

In reality, we cannot comprehend with our minds either a point or a line, neither an abstract point that has neither size nor coordinates. Nor an infinite line that moves infinitely, just as we cannot comprehend infinity with our minds.

We will imagine and imagine and imagine, and our mind is a speculative instrument. It will always build some kind of picture of this infinity, a model, a projection, a formula, but it will not lead us to its perception in reality.

This comes directly through the experience of unity with this infinity, which we are trying to achieve as a result of the meditative exercises of multidimensional meditation, using the figures of the universal matrix.

And so, the first block, consisting of figures, a point and a line, begins with immersion in a point, filling a point, realizing the difference between a point and a line.

A line consisting of many points, of many different states.

For example, from a point as infinity, from a point as a filled unit of something.

Movement along this line.

And ultimately a line as an infinite movement in two directions.

When I pronounce these ideas, talk about the meanings of the figures, you should intuitively have sensations that you have worked through in previous exercises.

If this does not happen, then pay attention, enough time and attention to concentration, to each of the stages.

Immerse yourself in them for 15 to 30 minutes, as I said, meditate in each state. Move on to the next one in stages.

From an infinite point, from its immersion in the void, to a point as filling a ball with your presence and moving away from it to an infinite height.

After that, to the idea of the existence of possible different states in a line, which personifies the direction of your attention.

After that, move on to the movement between these states.

And in the end, try in one direction or another: vertically, horizontally, diagonally, as it suits you best, to feel this movement in two directions. At the same time, it can happen to expand and to narrow at the same time. That is, expansion can go up, narrowing can go down. Or it can be horizontal. But do not combine several directions for now, these are the next figures.

In this case, it is direct movement along a line.

Immersion in these states allows you to penetrate deeper into the nature of your emotions and perception algorithms, as well as learn to evoke deep meditative immersions in yourself.

Each of the techniques associated with the figures is self-sufficient and can be performed independently to evoke a particular state and immerse yourself in it.

The essence of multidimensional meditation is in the phased implementation, in the consistent implementation of all techniques that develop a certain more collected, more concentrated, conscious and deep meditative state that can simultaneously hold attention at different levels.

Therefore, the meditation is called multidimensional. If now you are trying to simultaneously hold your attention, for example, on a point as an immersion in the void, on a point as a filled unit of something. As on the possibility of the existence of an event.

In the same way, you can simultaneously hold your attention on a line as an independent figure.

Two different points, which in itself creates a line, but you do not immerse yourself in this idea.

You are trying to keep your attention on each point separately, a part of your attention.

For example, two points in the same coordinates and a line in others. Not where the two points are.

Distribute your attention into three parts and feel simultaneously the infinite movement, the infinite decrease and the filling of the unit with the sensation of your presence.

Again, inhale, exhale. In this case, it does not switch you from one figure to another.

It does not create movement between the figures, but enhances the concentration of a separate part of the attention in each of these figures.

It enhances the part of the attention in the point, the part of the attention in another way of perceiving the point, and the part of the attention in the line.

Devote 15 to 30 minutes to this practice.
