# 2.2.5 Multidimensional Meditation - Theory - The Line as an Independent Element

This stage of multidimensional meditation is dedicated to the line as an independent element. In the previous stages, we immersed ourselves in the awareness and feeling of the point as an abstract idea. It all began with its rethinking, with immersing ourselves in the idea that we cannot fully comprehend an abstract point with our minds; we will always be looking for a smaller size. This also connected it with the void, as we are infinitely falling there.

After that, we filled this point with our presence, moved to the macro level, where our state, our life, like a kind of sphere, was filled with our sensation and was also reduced to a point. Then, we moved on to the awareness of the point and the line.

A point is one of the possibilities for the existence of something. Each point denotes a possibility. A line is a multitude of different possibilities combined into a structure. You can perceive the two extreme points in a line as a segment and move along this line as you move through states.

Today, it is important to immerse yourself in the perception of the line as an independent figure. This is also directly related to the awareness of movement, but it will not be just a switch between different states, but something new.

The point appears from the intersection of the axes of coordinates and possibilities of movement—up, down, away from yourself, towards yourself, to the right, or to the left. It all starts with a point located at the intersection of these axes. Choosing one of the axes and starting to move along it in two directions allows us to understand the line.

For example, on a vertical axis, upward movement can have a symbolic meaning, like a spiritual ascent. Concentrating on the idea of simultaneous movement in two directions is like stretching a tourniquet. This movement in two directions also occurs with inhalation and exhalation.

This movement, this flow can be felt in different ways. The first was the sensation of falling. Another movement is breathing. The sensations of the flow of air and resistance to it, or friction against the walls of internal organs, and movement through the body with the blood can serve as starting points for perceiving a line as movement simultaneously in two directions.

Geometrically, a segment is a limited line between two points. A ray is an infinite line from one point in one direction. A line is movement in two directions, and it is infinite.

In reality, we cannot comprehend with our minds an abstract point that has neither size nor coordinates, nor an infinite line that moves infinitely, just as we cannot comprehend infinity. Our mind is a speculative instrument; it will always build a picture, a model, but it will not lead us to its perception. This comes directly through the experience of unity with this infinity, which we are trying to achieve through these meditative exercises.

The first block, consisting of the point and the line, begins with immersion in the point, filling the point, and realizing the difference between a point and a line. A line consists of many points, of many different states—for example, from a point as infinity, and from a point as a filled unit. Then comes movement along this line, and ultimately, the line as an infinite movement in two directions.

Immersion in these states allows you to penetrate deeper into the nature of your emotions and perception algorithms, as well as learn to evoke deep meditative immersions. Each technique is self-sufficient. The essence of multidimensional meditation is in the phased, consistent implementation of all techniques that develop a more collected, concentrated, conscious, and deep meditative state that can simultaneously hold attention at different levels. Therefore, the meditation is called multidimensional.
