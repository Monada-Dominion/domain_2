# 2.1.6 Multidimensional Meditation – Practice – The Point as an Independent Element

---

This is the **second stage** of the first block of multidimensional meditation. The first block is entirely dedicated to the point and the line. 
Each of the figures is considered both independently and in connection with the previous or the next one. 
The point is first considered in connection with the void, then as an independent unit, and further in connection with the line.

You have already become acquainted with the very first stage of multidimensional meditation, which is associated with the point and the void, where it is necessary to feel the fall and try to immerse yourself in this state. 
Now we will conduct a meditation associated with the point as an independent unit.

## Preparation

To do this, as always, you need to sit down, take a comfortable position, and relax. 
Relaxation can be done step by step:
- Start from the top of the head
- The muscles of the face
- The neck
- What is inside the head
- Then descending further through the neck, into the chest, into the arms, into the back, into the stomach
- Into the pelvis
- Into the legs down to the tips of the feet

As a result, the whole body can be relaxed in this way.

## Meditation

When the body is relaxed, we can begin the meditation. 
This time, we need to realize the point as an independent unit, as the possibility of the existence of some event. 
To do this:
- Mentally imagine three coordinate axes x, y, and z intersecting at point zero. 
- It is precisely at this point that we must place ourselves. 
- The presence of a coordinate system indicates that there is some kind of world, some kind of interconnection between all elements, and they relate to the center.

But at the very beginning of the meditation, we are precisely at the center of the intersection of the three axes. 
Therefore, first, let us concentrate on the existence of the axes, on the existence of the system, and place ourselves in the center. 
Next, we need to imagine ourselves again not as a person but as a point in the boundless universe. 
To do this, you can first imagine yourself as a sphere or place yourself inside some kind of sphere. 
This is quite simple to do. 

If you stretch out your arms, then at arm's length somewhere will be the boundary of the sphere in which you are located. 
Meditate on this a little. You are a kind of sphere located at the center of the intersection of the coordinate axes. 
What are these axes, and why are they needed? Do not burden your mind, do not think about how they are formed. 
Just be at the center of the intersection of the axes in the form of a sphere.

## Visualization

And now, when you have imagined this, rise above yourself as if you were a quadcopter or a helicopter. 
Rise very high so that the sphere you imagined yourself to be turns into a point. 
Look at yourself from above or from afar. And observe that point which is at the intersection of the three axes. 
This independent unit reflects the possibility of the existence of something. 

Accordingly, you, as a person, exist, and you exist in an infinite boundless universe. 
Many options and possibilities for the development of events are near and within you. 
The fact that you exist is the realization of possibilities. There are very many of these possibilities. 
There are many other people, and besides people, there are many animals, objects, and other forms of life.

And what you represent is the realization of one of an infinite number of possibilities. 
Therefore, try to hold on to the idea of a filled point. 
If last time we imagined the fall and infinite division of the point as some kind of void, falling into the void, constantly searching for something smaller, 
then at this moment, try to hold your concentration on the fact that something exists, something is present, something is in this point. 
This is life, energy, soul, consciousness, attention, state, something that fills it, that creates the possibility of the existence of an event, the possibility of the existence of your life. 

With each inhale and exhale, fill your point, your sphere, with warmth. Fill it with presence. With concentrated attention. 
But do not forget to distance yourself so that the sphere is still a point, and as if you are looking at the surface of the planet from space. 
You know that in some point you are yourself, but you do not see yourself. 
You can only see some point of some color – black, green, blue, white, orange, any color. 

This point is **You**. In it is your life. With each inhale and exhale, strengthen these sensations of presence in this point. 
And try to part with your human form. Do not look at yourself as a body, do not feel yourself as a body. 
Feel yourself as relaxed energy, gathered, concentrated in one point, which you see from afar. 

> Dedicate 15 to 30 minutes to this meditation.
